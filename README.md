# üå≤ Forest and Bird NZ Website Redesign

## ‚ú® Project Overview 

I had created this project for my Formative 4.1 assessment and was tasked with creating a website redesign for an organisation in New Zealand, in doing so, I also had to research and apply any and all cultural and sociological issues that came along with this practice. I had chosen Forest and Bird NZ as my client for the project and I had considered and applied a few of the cultural and sociological issues that are plaguing their practice such as; __public awareness and education, tourism and eco-tourism, and conservation vs consumerism.__ In order to overcome those issues, I had designed a website that was minimal with a clear and easy navigation system and including the most important and relevant information for users.
